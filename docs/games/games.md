## What is it?

For now this page will display the games I have spent the most amount of time on based on my steam account.
I only kept the games on which I have more than 50 hours of playtime.

### Game's page

On the image above, you can see what I display when clicking on one of the game. It pretty much displays what you can find on the game's steam store page.
